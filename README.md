# handy-command

.Net Standard libary which implements ICommand interface and provides Command and AsyncCommand classes that are tipically used
to provide commanding behaviour to user interfaces.

This particular library does not rely on CommandManager which is part of WPF, therefore it can be used with Xamarin and Mono.
